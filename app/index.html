                            Programming to an interface is good because it allows you to swap classes in and out based on application needs. 
                            Interfaces also allow for easier unit and integration testing, as you can swap the real class out for a mocked version.
                            Similar to a contract. By implementing an interface, you <b>must</b> have all functions defined.

                            Let's say you have a function that does something like this. So we're clearly creating a new string called a and then potentially using it later on.
                            This isn't an incorrect thing to do. However, doing it this way could be really controlling with what exact string is being used.
                            It removes your ability to use any other string in place of the one you've created here. Inversion of Control can help us out with this.

                            Here's virtually the same thing again, but this time we're using Inversion of Control. Now, we're giving whoever is calling the function the 
                            ability and the permission to pass through any string they can think of. This makes it the callers responsibility, and gives us the option of using a different string 
                            easily later down the road.

                        IoC <b>inverts</b> the <b>control</b>, so that the person calling the class can define how the class works.
                        <aside class="notes">
                            Basically, you can think of Inversion of Control as literally inverting the control to outside of the class. So whoever is calling the class, gets to decide how the class works.

                            Does this look familiar? This is what Dependency Injection looks like in code.<br/>
                            It's literally the act of passing a parameter into a class.<br/>
                            You are literally injecting the dependency by passing it through as a parameter, so now msg IS a dependency of MethodA.<br/>
                            We could even go as far as calling it Parameter Passing instead of Dependency Injection.<br/>

                            So far, we've looked at DI on a function level, passing variables into functions and what not.. Although this IS a form of DI, normally when you hear the 
                            term Dependency Injection, it's actually in reference to passing variables into <i>classes</i>, not functions.

                        <aside class="notes">
                            Notice that we're actually passing the msg variable into the class when we new it up!
                            On the other side of things, the class is capturing that variable in the constructor.

                    <section>
                        Since we've configured Ninject correctly, we can add a constructor, like so, taking a fooService parameter of type IFooService.
                        <span class="fragment"><pre><code data-trim>
                            public class BarController : Controller

                                public BarController(IFooService fooService)
                                {

                                }

                    <section>
                        Now, since an instance of FooService is being passed to the constructor, we have to capture it somehow to use throughout the class.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        To do this we can add a private variable to the top of the class and set it equal to the instance being passed into the constructor.
                        <span class="fragment"><pre><code data-trim>
                            public class BarController : Controller

                                public BarController(IFooService fooService)
                                {
                                    _fooService = fooService;
                                }

                    <section>
