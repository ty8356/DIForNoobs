Allows us to address requirements that come up in the future.

Note:
Example: Imagine a wall plug. If everything were wired directly to the wall, we wouldn't have the ability to plug and unplug things from the wall at will. 
It would take a professional to come and wire what we need into the wall. This is similar to tightly coupled code. But, if instead we have the combination 
of plugs and sockets, we are able to plug and unplug anything we want with ease at any time. This is similar to loosley coupled code. The socket represents 
an interface and the plug represents the piece of code you're changing, so as long as the plug fits into the socket, everything works.
