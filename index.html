                        So my boss told me to learn about <b>Dependency Injection</b> because it allows for more <b>decoupled code</b>...

                        This presentation will be directed specifically at Dependency Injection in .NET using C#, but you can take these ideas and use them in most other frameworks and languages.

                    <section>
                        Before we get into answering the specifics, we should take a few steps back.

                        Let's start off with the <b>problem</b> and where it stems from...
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        It's generally accepted that programming to an <b>interface</b> is a good practice to get into.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        This allows you to swap classes in and out based on the situation without breaking anything within the application.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        As long as the class meets the <b>requirements</b> of the interface and the functions return the expected results, everything just works.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        Let's take a look at an example...
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
                            public class Foo
                            {
                                public Foo(IDatabasePersister db) 
                                {
                                    // some code here
                                }
                            }

                        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
                            public interface IDatabasePersister
                            {
                                Object GetItemById();
                                void Create();
                                void Read();
                                void Update();
                                void Delete();
                            }

                        Writing your application in this way allows you to use any type of data storage, as long as you write a class that conforms to the interface.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        This is a <b>huge advantage</b>, especially when writing large business applications.

                        This structure, passing an interface to the constructor, is known as <b>Inversion of Control</b>, or <b>IoC</b>.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <b>Inversion of Control</b> is a software development technique in which you allow the person <b>calling</b> the class to select a concrete implementation type, as opposed to selecting one <b>yourself</b>.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        You're literally <b>inverting</b> the control.

                        Let's take a look at IoC in <b>code</b>...

                                {
                                    var db = new Database();
                                    var foo = new Foo(db);
                                }
                            }
                        </code></pre>
                        <span class="fragment">Notice that the <b>IDatabasePersister</b> interface is now a <b>dependency</b> of Foo.</span>

                    <section>
                        This is because you <b>must</b> pass an instance of <b>IDatabasePersister</b> through when calling the class.
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        This form of <b>IoC</b> is known as <B>Dependency Injection (DI)</b> because you are <b>injecting</b> the dependency into the class through the constructor.

                    <section>
                        <b>Dependency Injection</b> is a set of software design principles and patterns that enable us to develop loosely couled code.

                        So what's the <b>problem</b> with Inversion of Control using Dependency Injection?
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        Well, when a class has <b>multiple dependencies</b>, things start to get pretty crazy...
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        For example...

                    <section>
                        So we've seen how to inject a single dependency into a class.
